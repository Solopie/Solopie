### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Jesse**

I primarily do CTF competitions in my spare time. Hopefully I post writeups here. If not, well... feel free to call me lazy :)

Languages I code in at the moment are:
- Python (exploit scripts, web apps)
- Java (competitive programming)
- JavaScript/NodeJS (discord bots, web apps, typescript coming soon)
- ... this is a small list sadge ...

I can say I generally know how to read other languages through like PHP, C, C# due to code reviews in CTFs but I can't say I can code in them confidently.

On the journey to learning Go though so hopefully can expand the list soon ðŸ¤ž

That's it for now! Thanks for dropping by and feel free to connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-nguyen-687859157/

Pssst I'm also looking for a job at the moment... hit me up on LinkedIn if you know of any roles I may be interested in!
